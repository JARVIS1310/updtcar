# BMW M4 Landing Page

A landing page for the BMW M4 that I built while learning HTML and CSS.
I wanted to try making something that looks like a real car brand website, so I picked the M4 as the theme.

## About the Project

I made this project to practice frontend development and try building something that actually looks good.

The idea was simple — take a car I think looks amazing (the BMW M4) and try to build a page around it that feels premium. I focused a lot on layout, spacing, and making it work on mobile too since that was something I was still getting comfortable with.

It's not perfect but I learned a lot building it.
