                <p>The steering of a McLaren isn't just about control — it's about connection. Every curve, every
                    input, every road surface translates instantly through the wheel into your hands. Crafted with
                    precision engineering and wrapped in premium materials, McLaren steering is designed to deliver
                    unmatched feedback and responsiveness. It's not only about turning the car, it's about feeling the
                    soul of a supercar engineered for perfection — where agility meets confidence, and control becomes
                    instinct. Every motion is deliberate, every response immediate — a harmony between driver and
                    machine. In a McLaren, the steering isn't just a component; it's the heartbeat of performance.</p>

                    crafted for precision and elegance. At the core of McLaren's performance lies its advanced gearbox
                    — engineered for seamless shifts at lightning speed. Whether cruising effortlessly or unleashing
                    maximum power on the track, the gearbox adapts instantly, delivering torque with razor-sharp
